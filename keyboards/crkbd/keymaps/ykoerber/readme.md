# info
- reduce timing (only LT, but permissive-hold helps here)
- can roll on character layer (home-row mods on other layers + special character with home row mods <= I like this much more than e.g. callum mods)
- intellij layer for easier access of common shortcuts inside the IDE.

# make
```bash
make crkbd/rev1:ykoerber -j 4
```
